# practicing with the format operator:

number = 44
num = 44.88 

print('I have %.2f zyn cans' % number)
print('i have %d grams of weed' % num)
print('i have seen %d %s in my lifetime and that makes me %.2f times happier than anything else' % (number, 'camels', num))

n = 44.6688

print('%.2f' % n)

x = '%.1f' % n
