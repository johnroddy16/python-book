# practicing with nested loops because i do not feel a good enough understanding:

names = ['john', 'james', 'carolyn', 'ben']

for i in range(4):
    for a in range(4):
        print(i)
    print()





nums = [8, 4, 16, 7, 22, 11]

for i in range(len(nums)):  # for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for a in range(len(nums)):  # for a in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print(nums[i])
    print()
